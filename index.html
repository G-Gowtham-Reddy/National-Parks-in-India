        <h2>Conserving Nature for Future Generations</h2>
        <p>India is home to over 100 national parks, each playing a vital role in conserving biodiversity and providing habitats for countless species.</p>
        <p>These parks are vital to maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the survival of endangered species like the Bengal tiger, Indian elephant, and one-horned rhinoceros.</p>

            <h3>Jim Corbett National Park</h3>
            <img src="Bengal-Tiger_Corbett_Uttarakhand_Dec-2013.jpg" alt="Jim Corbett National Park">
            <b>1. History and Background</b><br>
            •	Named after the hunter-turned-conservationist Jim Corbett, this park was originally called Hailey National Park. It was established in 1936 and later renamed to honor Corbett, who advocated for wildlife conservation.<br>
            •	Known for its role in tiger conservation, Jim Corbett was one of the first parks to join Project Tiger in 1973, a flagship conservation project aimed at protecting Bengal tigers.<br>
            <b>2. Zones and Safari Experiences</b><br>
            •	The park is divided into six tourism zones: Dhikala, Bijrani, Jhirna, Dhela, Durga Devi, and Sonanadi.<br>
            •	Dhikala is popular for its overnight stays and scenic landscapes, while Bijrani is known for frequent tiger sightings.<br>
            •	Safari types: Jeep safari, Canter safari (large open vehicles for group safaris), and elephant safaris are available in specific zones.<br>
            <b>3. Flora and Fauna</b><br>
            •	Vegetation: Sal trees, riverine belts, and grasslands. The diversity in plant life supports a wide range of species.<br>
            •	Other Wildlife: Leopards, wild boars, sloth bears, and over 600 bird species, making it a haven for bird watchers.<br>
            
            <h3>Kaziranga National Park</h3><br>
            <img src="2.jpg" alt="Kaziranga National Park">
            <b>1. Unique Biodiversity and Ecosystem</b><br>
            •	Kaziranga’s diverse landscape of floodplains and grasslands creates the perfect habitat for the one-horned rhinoceros, a symbol of Assam.<br>
            •	The park has one of the highest densities of tigers among protected areas, though they are difficult to spot due to the tall grasslands.<br>
            <b>2. Zones and Safari Details</b><br>
            •	The park is divided into four main zones for tourism: Central (Kohora), Western (Bagori), Eastern (Agaratoli), and Burapahar.<br>
            •	Safari options include jeep and elephant safaris, with elephant safaris being popular for close encounters with rhinos and deer.<br>
            •	Best time for safaris: Early morning and late afternoon, as animals are more active.<br>
            <b>3. Challenges and Conservation</b><br>
            •	Seasonal Flooding: Annual floods from the Brahmaputra River can cause significant habitat disturbance. The flooding, however, also rejuvenates the grasslands.<br>
            •	Anti-Poaching Efforts: Poaching is a threat, primarily for rhino horn trafficking, but strict measures have helped reduce these incidents.<br>
            <h3>Ranthambore National Park</h3><br>
            <img src="3.jpg" alt="Ranthambore National Park">
            <b>1. Historical Significance</b><br>
            •	Ranthambore Fort, dating back to the 10th century, is located within the park, offering a unique blend of history and wildlife.<br>
            •	The fort’s strategic position offers panoramic views of the park, and its ancient temples, mosques, and step-wells provide a historical context to the landscape.<br>
            <b>2. Tiger Tourism and Conservation</b><br>
            •	Ranthambore is renowned for tiger tourism, and it’s common to see tigers near water bodies like Padam Talao and Rajbagh Lake.<br>
            •	The park is divided into 10 zones; Zones 1-5 are the best for tiger sightings, though sightings are possible throughout the park.<br>
            <b>3. Wildlife Beyond Tigers</b><br>
            •	Other Species: Leopards, sloth bears, Indian gazelles, and a variety of birds like Indian owlets and serpent eagles.<br>
            •	Flora: Dry deciduous forests with Dhok trees, interspersed with lakes and small ponds, making it a semi-arid yet rich ecosystem.<br>
            <h3>Sundarbans National Park</h3><br>
            <img src="4.jpg" alt="Sundarbans National Park">
            <b>1. Unique Mangrove Ecosystem</b><br>
            •	The Sundarbans, as the world's largest mangrove forest, plays a crucial role in flood control and serves as a protective barrier against cyclones and storms in the region.<br>
            •	It's the only place in India where the unique behavior of “swimming tigers” is observed, with Bengal tigers adapted to a semi-aquatic lifestyle.<br>
            <b>2. Biodiversity</b><br>
            •	Home to endangered species like the estuarine crocodile, Olive Ridley turtles, and the Gangetic dolphin.<br>
            •	Rich birdlife includes kingfishers, eagles, and migratory birds that flock to the delta during winter.<br>
            <b>3. Boat Safari and Visitor Experience</b><br>
            •	Due to the marshy terrain, visitors explore Sundarbans via boat safaris rather than traditional land safaris.<br>
            •	Boat safaris provide a glimpse of the mangrove landscape and a chance to see wildlife near water sources. Permits are required, and organized tours are common.<br>
            <b>4. Conservation Efforts and Challenges</b><br>
            •	Ongoing conservation is crucial due to threats from rising sea levels and human-wildlife conflicts.<br>
            •	The park plays a key role in tiger conservation under Project Tiger.<br>
            <h3>Gir National Park</h3><br>
            <img src="5.jpg" alt="Gir National Park">
            <b>1. Habitat and Terrain</b><br>

            •	Terrain: A mix of open grasslands, rocky hills, and water bodies, which supports a diverse range of flora and fauna.<br>
            <b>2. Asiatic Lions</b><br>
            •	Gir is the last refuge for Asiatic lions, with a population that has been gradually increasing due to successful conservation.<br>
            •	To reduce genetic isolation, efforts are underway to establish a second Asiatic lion population in another Indian sanctuary.<br>
            <b>3. Other Wildlife and Flora</b><br>
            •	Apart from lions, Gir is home to leopards, marsh crocodiles, hyenas, sambar deer, and a variety of birds.<br>
            •	The park has around 400 plant species, contributing to its ecosystem's biodiversity.<br>
            <b>4. Safari Options</b><br>
            •	Gir offers jeep safaris, which operate in three designated zones for tourism. Permits are limited to maintain the ecosystem and avoid disturbances to wildlife.<br>
            •	Best visiting time: December to March, as the hot summer season limits animal activity.<br>
            <b>5. Conservation Challenges</b><br>
            •	Threats: Human-wildlife conflict, especially as lions sometimes wander into nearby villages.<br>
            •	The park's management team is working on strategies to minimize these conflicts and ensure the safety of both wildlife and villagers.<br>
