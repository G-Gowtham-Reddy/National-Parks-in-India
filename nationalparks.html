                Jim Corbett National Park, located in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand, India, is the oldest national park in the country, established in 1936 as Hailey National Park.

The park is renowned for its Bengal tiger population and is a popular destination for wildlife enthusiasts and photographers.

Besides tigers, the park is home to a large number of elephants, leopards, Himalayan black bears, and over 600 bird species, making it one of the richest bird habitats in India.
